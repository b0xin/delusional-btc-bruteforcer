## I do not know how low the odds are, but I know it's not 0 - *b0xin 2023*.

"If only I had the foresight to buy Bitcoin when I was literally 4 years old.' If you have felt the same way as me, fear not. 

I have the solution for you!

Using Key from the Bit library, we can generate keys randomly and match their private address to a list of Bitcoin addresses scraped online.

If a match is found, there is a function to append the WIF to a text file. However, I fear this might be the most useless line I've written because it'll never be called.

People have told me that I'm 26978585563214397815370686162322438922010714041388761425782288911442947260 times more likely to die in a car crash but I never leave home, so they're wrong.

If anyone ever finds anything please send me a few Bitcoin, thanks!


Btw go and scrape the top BTC wallet addresses from somewhere.
